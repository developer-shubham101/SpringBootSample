In Spring, it’s common to have multiple beans of the same type. When you do, you may encounter issues with `@Autowired` or dependency injection because Spring doesn't know which bean to inject. Here are several ways to handle multiple beans of the same type in Spring:

### 1. **Using `@Qualifier`**
- You can use `@Qualifier` with `@Autowired` to specify which bean you want to inject by its name.

   ```java
   @Component
   public class MyServiceOne implements MyService { /* ... */ }

   @Component
   public class MyServiceTwo implements MyService { /* ... */ }

   @Service
   public class MyClientService {
       private final MyService myService;

       @Autowired
       public MyClientService(@Qualifier("myServiceOne") MyService myService) {
           this.myService = myService;
       }
   }
   ```

Here, `@Qualifier("myServiceOne")` specifies that `myServiceOne` bean should be injected into `myService`.

### 2. **Using `@Primary`**
- If you want one bean to be injected by default, you can use the `@Primary` annotation. Spring will inject the primary bean when no `@Qualifier` is specified.

   ```java
   @Component
   @Primary
   public class MyPrimaryService implements MyService { /* ... */ }

   @Component
   public class MySecondaryService implements MyService { /* ... */ }

   @Service
   public class MyClientService {
       @Autowired
       private MyService myService;  // Will inject MyPrimaryService
   }
   ```

In this example, `MyPrimaryService` is marked with `@Primary`, so it’s used as the default bean unless another specific one is requested.

### 3. **Injecting All Beans of a Type with `@Autowired` and `@Qualifier`**
- You can inject a collection of all beans of a specific type using `@Autowired` on a `List` or `Map`. This approach is helpful if you want to access all beans of a certain type.

   ```java
   @Service
   public class MyClientService {
       @Autowired
       private List<MyService> myServices;  // All MyService beans will be injected here
   }
   ```

Alternatively, you can inject a map with bean names as keys and the beans as values:

   ```java
   @Service
   public class MyClientService {
       @Autowired
       private Map<String, MyService> myServicesMap;  // All MyService beans injected with their names
   }
   ```

### 4. **Using Custom Qualifiers**
- You can create custom qualifiers to make the code more readable and intuitive, especially when there are many beans of the same type.

   ```java
   @Qualifier
   @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
   @Target({ ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.METHOD })
   public @interface MyServiceOne {}

   @Component
   @MyServiceOne
   public class MyServiceOneImpl implements MyService { /* ... */ }

   @Service
   public class MyClientService {
       @Autowired
       @MyServiceOne
       private MyService myService;  // Will inject MyServiceOneImpl
   }
   ```

### 5. **Using `@Resource`**
- You can use `@Resource` to specify the bean by its name. `@Resource` works similarly to `@Autowired` with `@Qualifier`, but it’s part of Java’s `javax.annotation` package.

   ```java
   @Service
   public class MyClientService {
       @Resource(name = "myServiceOne")
       private MyService myService;  // Injects the myServiceOne bean
   }
   ```

### 6. **Using Conditional Beans with `@Conditional`**
- Sometimes, you only want one of the beans to be instantiated based on certain conditions. You can use `@Conditional` with a custom condition or Spring’s built-in conditions to create conditional beans.

   ```java
   @Component
   @Conditional(MyCustomCondition.class)
   public class ConditionalServiceOne implements MyService { /* ... */ }

   @Component
   @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "myapp.feature.enabled", havingValue = "true")
   public class ConditionalServiceTwo implements MyService { /* ... */ }
   ```

In this example, `ConditionalServiceOne` or `ConditionalServiceTwo` beans will only be instantiated if certain conditions are met.

### 7. **Using Profiles**
- If different beans should be active in different environments, you can annotate them with `@Profile`.

   ```java
   @Component
   @Profile("dev")
   public class DevService implements MyService { /* ... */ }

   @Component
   @Profile("prod")
   public class ProdService implements MyService { /* ... */ }

   @Service
   public class MyClientService {
       @Autowired
       private MyService myService;  // Will inject either DevService or ProdService based on active profile
   }
   ```

Here, only one of the beans will be loaded depending on the active Spring profile (e.g., `dev` or `prod`).

### Choosing the Right Strategy

The best approach depends on your needs:
- Use `@Primary` for a single default implementation.
- Use `@Qualifier` or custom qualifiers to specify a particular bean.
- Use `@Profile` for environment-specific beans.
- Use `@Conditional` for beans that should only be created under specific conditions.
