Let's go through the annotations used in the provided Spring Boot application and explain them along with some additional values that can be passed into them:

1. **@SpringBootApplication**:
    - Explanation: This annotation is a combination of multiple Spring annotations, including @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. It is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application.
    - Additional values:
        - `exclude`: Class[] - Specify classes to be excluded from auto-configuration.
        - `scanBasePackages`: String[] - Specify base packages to scan for Spring components.

2. **@RestController**:
    - Explanation: This annotation is used to mark a class as a controller in a Spring MVC application. It indicates that the data returned by the methods will be written directly into the HTTP response body as JSON or XML.
    - Additional values: None.

3. **@RequestMapping**:
    - Explanation: This annotation is used at the class level or method level to map HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers.
    - Additional values:
        - `value`: String[] - Specify one or more URL patterns to map the request to.
        - `method`: RequestMethod[] - Specify HTTP request methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
        - `params`: String[] - Specify request parameters required to invoke the method.
        - `headers`: String[] - Specify HTTP headers required to invoke the method.
        - `consumes`: String[] - Specify media types that the method can consume.
        - `produces`: String[] - Specify media types that the method can produce.

4. **@GetMapping**, **@PostMapping**, **@PutMapping**, **@DeleteMapping**:
    - Explanation: These annotations are shortcuts for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET/POST/PUT/DELETE). They are used to map HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to handler methods.
    - Additional values: Same as @RequestMapping.

5. **@RequestBody**:
    - Explanation: This annotation is used to indicate that a method parameter should be bound to the body of the HTTP request.
    - Additional values:
        - `required`: boolean - Specify whether the request body is required or not. Default is true.

6. **@PathVariable**:
    - Explanation: This annotation is used to bind a method parameter to a URI template variable.
    - Additional values:
        - `value`: String - Specify the name of the path variable.

7. **@Autowired**:
    - Explanation: This annotation is used to automatically wire beans by type from the Spring application context.
    - Additional values:
        - `required`: boolean - Specify whether the injection is required. Default is true.

8. **@Document**:
    - Explanation: This annotation is used at the class level to indicate that a class is a MongoDB document and to specify the collection where the document will be stored.
    - Additional values:
        - `collection`: String - Specify the name of the collection in MongoDB.

9. **@Id**:
    - Explanation: This annotation is used at the field level to mark a field as the primary key of a MongoDB document.
    - Additional values: None.

10. **@Service**:
- Explanation: This annotation is used to mark a class as a service in a Spring application. It indicates that the class contains business logic.
- Additional values: None.

11. **@Repository**:
- Explanation: This annotation is used to mark a class as a repository in a Spring application. It indicates that the class will interact with a database or external data source.
- Additional values: None.

These annotations play a crucial role in Spring Boot applications by providing metadata to the Spring container, which is used for configuration and bean management.
