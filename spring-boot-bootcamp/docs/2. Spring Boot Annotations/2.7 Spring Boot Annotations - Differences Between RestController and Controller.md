In **Spring Framework**, both `@RestController` and `@Controller` are used to define controllers that handle HTTP requests, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here's a comparison of **`@RestController`** and **`@Controller`**:

### **1. `@RestController`**

- **Purpose**: `@RestController` is a specialized version of `@Controller` in **Spring Boot** that is used for creating **RESTful web services**. It combines the behavior of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.

- **Automatically Adds `@ResponseBody`**: When you use `@RestController`, the response from the methods is automatically serialized into JSON or XML and returned in the HTTP response body. There is no need to annotate each method with `@ResponseBody`.

#### Example:
```java
@RestController
public class MyRestController {

    @GetMapping("/api/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

In this example, the response `"Hello, World!"` is automatically serialized as JSON (or another configured format) and returned to the client without needing `@ResponseBody`.

- **Main Use Case**: `@RestController` is primarily used for **REST APIs** where the server responds with **data** (typically JSON or XML) rather than rendering views.

#### Advantages:
- Simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs by avoiding the need for `@ResponseBody` in each method.
- Returns **JSON**, **XML**, or other data formats by default, rather than rendering a web page (view).

### **2. `@Controller`**

- **Purpose**: `@Controller` is a more general-purpose annotation used for **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** controllers in Spring. It is typically used when you want to return **views** (e.g., HTML) rather than JSON or XML data.

- **View Rendering**: Unlike `@RestController`, methods in a `@Controller` return **view names** (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf templates). The returned view name is resolved by a **ViewResolver** to render the web page.

- **Requires `@ResponseBody` for Data**: If you want to return data (like JSON) from a `@Controller`, you need to explicitly add the `@ResponseBody` annotation to the method. Without `@ResponseBody`, the method would return a view name by default.

#### Example (without `@ResponseBody`):
```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "hello"; // returns the view name "hello"
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The method returns the view name `hello`, and the message "Hello, World!" is added to the model.
- The **ViewResolver** will look for a view (e.g., a Thymeleaf or JSP page) called `hello.html` or `hello.jsp` to render the response.

#### Example (with `@ResponseBody`):
```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/api/hello")
    @ResponseBody
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```
In this case, adding `@ResponseBody` tells Spring to return `"Hello, World!"` as the response body, serialized as JSON or XML, instead of rendering a view.

#### Advantages:
- Used when you want to **render web pages** as responses, typically in **MVC**-based web applications.
- Provides more flexibility for web applications where views and UI are involved.

### **Key Differences**

| Aspect                        | `@RestController`                            | `@Controller`                              |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                    | Used for building **RESTful APIs**.          | Used for handling **web pages (MVC)**.     |
| **Automatic Serialization**    | Automatically serializes response data to **JSON/XML** (or other formats). | No automatic serialization. Typically used to return **views** (e.g., HTML pages). |
| **Response Type**              | Returns **data** directly in the HTTP response body (e.g., JSON). | Returns **view names** to be resolved by a **ViewResolver** (e.g., Thymeleaf, JSP). |
| **`@ResponseBody` Requirement**| Not required (applied implicitly).           | Required if you want to return data instead of views. |
| **Use Case**                   | REST APIs where the client expects JSON/XML. | MVC-based web applications where views need to be rendered (e.g., HTML pages). |
| **View Rendering**             | Doesn’t render views. Directly returns data. | Renders views like HTML, JSP, or Thymeleaf templates. |

### **When to Use `@RestController` vs `@Controller`**

- Use **`@RestController`**:
    - When building **RESTful services**.
    - When you need to return **JSON**, **XML**, or other structured data formats directly to the client.
    - When you're building a **microservice** or an API that doesn’t serve HTML pages but instead handles **data responses**.

- Use **`@Controller`**:
    - When building a **web application** where you need to return **views** (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf).
    - When you need to follow the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern to build web pages.
    - When your primary goal is rendering **UI** and web pages for users to interact with.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **`@RestController`** simplifies the development of RESTful APIs by automatically serializing responses as JSON or XML. It is best suited for cases where you’re delivering data rather than web pages.
- **`@Controller`** is used when you need to return views (web pages) and follow the MVC pattern, making it more suitable for traditional web applications where rendering UI is required.
