setting up MySQL and phpMyAdmin with Docker is a very common and convenient approach, especially for development. You'll use Docker Compose to define and run these multi-container applications.

Here's how to do it:

**1. Install Docker and Docker Compose:**

*   **Docker Desktop:** If you're on Windows or macOS, Docker Desktop is the easiest way to get both Docker Engine and Docker Compose. Download it from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
*   **Linux:**
    *   Install Docker Engine: Follow the official instructions for your distribution (e.g., [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/))
    *   Install Docker Compose: Follow the official instructions ([https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))

**2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:**

In the root directory of your Spring Boot project (or any convenient location), create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8' # Or a newer compatible version

services:
  # MySQL Service
  mysql_db:
    image: mysql:8.0 # Or mysql:latest, but pinning versions is good practice
    container_name: my_mysql_db
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: your_strong_root_password # CHANGE THIS!
      MYSQL_DATABASE: spring_boot_db # Your application's database name
      MYSQL_USER: spring_user # Your application's database userEntity
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: your_strong_user_password # CHANGE THIS!
    ports:
      - "3306:3306" # Map host port 3306 to container port 3306
    volumes:
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql # Persist data even if container is removed
      # Optional: Mount custom MySQL configuration files
      # - ./my-custom.cnf:/etc/mysql/conf.d/custom.cnf
    networks:
      - app-network
    healthcheck:
        test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin" ,"ping", "-h", "localhost", "-u${MYSQL_USER}", "-p${MYSQL_PASSWORD}"]
        timeout: 20s
        retries: 10

  # phpMyAdmin Service
  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin:latest
    container_name: my_phpmyadmin
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8081:80" # Map host port 8081 to container port 80 (phpMyAdmin's default)
    environment:
      PMA_HOST: mysql_db # This MUST be the service name of your MySQL container
      PMA_PORT: 3306
      # Optional: You can also set PMA_USER and PMA_PASSWORD if you want to auto-login
      # PMA_USER: root
      # PMA_PASSWORD: your_strong_root_password
      UPLOAD_LIMIT: 1G # Optional: Increase upload limit for large SQL imports
    depends_on:
      mysql_db: # Wait for mysql_db to be healthy (if healthcheck is defined) or started
        condition: service_healthy # or service_started if no healthcheck
    networks:
      - app-network

# Volumes to persist data
volumes:
  mysql_data:
    driver: local # Or just 'mysql_data:'

# Network for services to communicate
networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```

**Explanation of `docker-compose.yml`:**

*   **`version: '3.8'`**: Specifies the Docker Compose file format version.
*   **`services:`**: Defines the different application components (containers).
    *   **`mysql_db:`**:
        *   `image: mysql:8.0`: Uses the official MySQL image, version 8.0. You can use `mysql:latest` but specific versions are better for consistency.
        *   `container_name: my_mysql_db`: A friendly name for your MySQL container.
        *   `restart: unless-stopped`: Ensures the container restarts automatically unless manually stopped.
        *   `environment:`: Sets environment variables required by the MySQL image.
            *   `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: **Crucial! Set a strong password for the MySQL root userEntity.**
            *   `MYSQL_DATABASE`: Creates a database named `spring_boot_db` on startup.
            *   `MYSQL_USER`: Creates a userEntity named `spring_user`.
            *   `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Sets the password for `spring_user`. **Change this too!**
        *   `ports: - "3306:3306"`: Maps port 3306 on your host machine to port 3306 inside the MySQL container. This allows your Spring Boot application (running on your host) to connect.
        *   `volumes: - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql`: This is very important for data persistence. It creates a named volume `mysql_data` and mounts it to the MySQL data directory inside the container. This way, your database data will survive even if you remove and recreate the container.
        *   `networks: - app-network`: Connects this service to a custom bridge network.
        *   `healthcheck`: Checks if MySQL is up and running. `phpmyadmin` can wait for this.
    *   **`phpmyadmin:`**:
        *   `image: phpmyadmin:latest`: Uses the official phpMyAdmin image.
        *   `container_name: my_phpmyadmin`: A friendly name for your phpMyAdmin container.
        *   `restart: unless-stopped`: Same restart policy.
        *   `ports: - "8081:80"`: Maps port 8081 on your host to port 80 inside the phpMyAdmin container (phpMyAdmin runs on port 80 by default). You can choose a different host port if 8081 is in use.
        *   `environment:`:
            *   `PMA_HOST: mysql_db`: **Crucial!** This tells phpMyAdmin to connect to the MySQL service named `mysql_db`. Docker Compose handles the internal DNS resolution.
            *   `PMA_PORT: 3306`: The port MySQL is listening on (inside its container).
            *   `UPLOAD_LIMIT`: Useful if you need to import large SQL files.
        *   `depends_on: mysql_db`: Tells Docker Compose to start `phpmyadmin` only after `mysql_db` has started (or become healthy if a healthcheck is defined).
        *   `networks: - app-network`: Connects this service to the same custom bridge network.
*   **`volumes:`**:
    *   `mysql_data:`: Defines the named volume used by the `mysql_db` service for data persistence.
*   **`networks:`**:
    *   `app-network:`: Defines a custom bridge network. This allows containers to communicate with each other using their service names (e.g., `mysql_db`).

**3. Run Docker Compose:**

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `docker-compose.yml`, and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

*   `up`: Creates and starts the containers.
*   `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

**First time run:** Docker will download the `mysql` and `phpmyadmin` images, which might take a few minutes.

**4. Accessing your services:**

*   **MySQL:**
    *   Your Spring Boot application can connect to MySQL at:
        *   Host: `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`)
        *   Port: `3306`
        *   Database: `spring_boot_db`
        *   Username: `spring_user`
        *   Password: `your_strong_user_password` (the one you set in `docker-compose.yml`)
*   **phpMyAdmin:**
    *   Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:8081`
    *   You'll see the phpMyAdmin login page.
    *   **Server:** It might already be pre-filled or you might need to enter `mysql_db` (the service name).
    *   **Username:** You can log in as `root` (with `your_strong_root_password`) or as `spring_user` (with `your_strong_user_password`).

**5. Spring Boot `application.properties` (or `application.yml`):**

Make sure your Spring Boot application's configuration points to this Dockerized MySQL instance:

```properties
# src/main/resources/application.properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/spring_boot_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
spring.datasource.username=spring_user
spring.datasource.password=your_strong_user_password # The password you set

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # Or create, create-drop, validate, none
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
```

*   `allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true`: Often needed for MySQL 8+ with certain authentication plugins.
*   `serverTimezone=UTC`: Good practice for time zone consistency.

**6. Managing your Docker Compose setup:**

*   **View running containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    docker ps
    ```
*   **View logs (useful for troubleshooting):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs mysql_db
    docker-compose logs phpmyadmin
    docker-compose logs -f # Follow logs for all services
    ```
*   **Stop containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose stop
    ```
*   **Stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes (defined in compose file):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
*   **Stop and remove containers, networks, AND THE NAMED VOLUME (`mysql_data` - DANGER: DELETES DATA):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```
    **Use `docker-compose down -v` with extreme caution, as it will delete your persisted database data.**

That's it! You now have a fully containerized MySQL and phpMyAdmin setup ready for your Spring Boot development. Remember to replace placeholder passwords with strong, unique ones.
