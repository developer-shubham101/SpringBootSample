Kotlin has grown to be a popular alternative to Java for many developers due to its concise syntax, modern features, and safety mechanisms. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive look at the main differences between Java 7 and Kotlin:

### 1. **Null Safety**
- **Java 7**: Null safety is not inherently managed, so `NullPointerExceptions` (NPEs) are a common problem.
- **Kotlin**: Has built-in null safety with nullable (`String?`) and non-nullable types (`String`). Kotlin enforces null checks at compile-time, reducing runtime NPEs.

   ```kotlin
   val name: String? = null  // Nullable type in Kotlin
   ```

### 2. **Data Classes**
- **Java 7**: Requires manual implementation of `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and other utility methods for classes meant to hold data.
- **Kotlin**: Has `data class` which automatically generates `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `copy()`, and `toString()` based on properties in the primary constructor.

   ```kotlin
   data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)
   ```

### 3. **Type Inference**
- **Java 7**: Requires explicit type declaration for most variables.
- **Kotlin**: Uses type inference to reduce verbosity. Types are inferred automatically based on the assigned value.

   ```kotlin
   val name = "John"  // Inferred as String
   ```

### 4. **Extension Functions**
- **Java 7**: Does not support extension functions. Utility methods are typically used in helper classes.
- **Kotlin**: Allows extending existing classes with new functions without modifying the original class. This improves modularity and readability.

   ```kotlin
   fun String.greet() = "Hello, $this!"
   ```

### 5. **Coroutines and Asynchronous Programming**
- **Java 7**: Asynchronous tasks require threads, `Runnable`, or `ExecutorService`, which can be complex and verbose.
- **Kotlin**: Provides coroutines for lightweight asynchronous programming, making it easier to handle concurrent tasks without blocking threads. Coroutines reduce callback hell and make asynchronous code look sequential.

   ```kotlin
   GlobalScope.launch {
       val data = fetchData()
       println(data)
   }
   ```

### 6. **Lambda Expressions**
- **Java 7**: Does not support lambda expressions (added in Java 8). Instead, anonymous inner classes are often used.
- **Kotlin**: Has built-in support for lambdas, enabling more concise and functional programming styles.

   ```kotlin
   val add = { x: Int, y: Int -> x + y }
   ```

### 7. **Functional Programming**
- **Java 7**: Java 7 is primarily object-oriented, with limited functional programming support.
- **Kotlin**: Kotlin is a hybrid, supporting both object-oriented and functional paradigms. It has features like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and higher-order functions.

   ```kotlin
   val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
   val doubled = numbers.map { it * 2 }
   ```

### 8. **Primary Constructors and `init` Block**
- **Java 7**: Classes require a separate constructor, and initializations are usually done within the constructor itself.
- **Kotlin**: Allows primary constructors and `init` blocks for cleaner and more concise initialization.

   ```kotlin
   class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
       init {
           require(age > 0) { "Age must be positive" }
       }
   }
   ```

### 9. **Smart Casts**
- **Java 7**: Explicit casting is required after type checks.
- **Kotlin**: Has smart casts, which automatically cast variables after type checks.

   ```kotlin
   fun checkType(x: Any) {
       if (x is String) {
           println(x.length)  // No cast needed
       }
   }
   ```

### 10. **Properties and Getters/Setters**
- **Java 7**: Uses explicit getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying properties.
- **Kotlin**: Has properties with implicit getters and setters, reducing boilerplate code.

   ```kotlin
   var age: Int = 18
       get() = field
       set(value) { field = value.coerceAtLeast(0) }
   ```

### 11. **Checked Exceptions**
- **Java 7**: Has checked exceptions that require handling (`try-catch` or `throws` declaration).
- **Kotlin**: Does not have checked exceptions, making exception handling less verbose but potentially reducing safety if not handled explicitly.

### 12. **Collections API Enhancements**
- **Java 7**: Has standard collection operations, but lacks extensive functional APIs.
- **Kotlin**: Extends collections with additional features such as `filter`, `map`, `find`, and `flatMap`, enhancing functional-style manipulation.

   ```kotlin
   val filteredList = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4).filter { it > 2 }
   ```

### 13. **No `static` Keyword**
- **Java 7**: Uses `static` to define class-level properties and methods.
- **Kotlin**: Replaces `static` with `companion object` inside classes. `object` keyword can also be used to create singleton classes.

   ```kotlin
   class MyClass {
       companion object {
           val CONSTANT = 100
       }
   }
   ```

### 14. **Default Arguments and Named Parameters**
- **Java 7**: No support for default arguments or named parameters, requiring multiple overloaded methods.
- **Kotlin**: Supports default arguments and named parameters, reducing the need for method overloading.

   ```kotlin
   fun greet(name: String, greeting: String = "Hello") = "$greeting, $name!"
   ```

### 15. **String Interpolation**
- **Java 7**: Uses concatenation for string formatting.
- **Kotlin**: Supports string interpolation, making string formatting more readable.

   ```kotlin
   val name = "Kotlin"
   println("Hello, $name!")
   ```

### 16. **Interoperability with Java**
- **Java 7**: No native support for Kotlin.
- **Kotlin**: Fully interoperable with Java, allowing Kotlin and Java code to coexist in the same project.

### 17. **Standard Library Functions**
- **Java 7**: Has a standard library but lacks a few modern utilities.
- **Kotlin**: Comes with an extensive standard library that includes useful functions for handling strings, collections, file I/O, and more.

In summary, Kotlin provides modern syntax, null safety, functional programming support, and other powerful language features that make it significantly different and often more concise and safer than Java 7.
