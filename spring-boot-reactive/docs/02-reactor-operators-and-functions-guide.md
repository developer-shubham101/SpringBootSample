Okay, let's dive deeper into `Flux`, `Mono`, and the rich set of operators (functions) that Project Reactor provides. These are the building blocks of reactive applications in Spring.

**Core Concepts: Publishers - `Mono` and `Flux`**

In Project Reactor, `Mono` and `Flux` are implementations of the Reactive Streams `Publisher` interface. They represent a stream of data that can emit items over time.

1.  **`Mono<T>` (Scalar - 0 or 1 item)**
    *   **Represents:** A publisher that will emit at most one item, or an error signal, or a completion signal.
    *   **Analogy:** Think of it like a `Future<T>` or `Optional<T>` but with reactive capabilities (lazy, composable, backpressure-aware).
    *   **Use Cases:**
        *   An operation that returns a single result (e.g., `findById(id)`).
        *   An operation that completes without a value (e.g., `save()` which might return `Mono<Void>` or `Mono<Entity>` if the saved entity is returned).
        *   A boolean result (e.g., `userExists() -> Mono<Boolean>`).
        *   An HTTP response body that is expected to be a single JSON object.

    **Common `Mono` Creation Methods:**
    *   `Mono.just(T data)`: Creates a `Mono` that emits the provided item and then completes.
        ```java
        Mono<String> nameMono = Mono.just("Alice");
        nameMono.subscribe(System.out::println); // Output: Alice
        ```
    *   `Mono.empty()`: Creates a `Mono` that completes without emitting any item.
        ```java
        Mono<Object> emptyMono = Mono.empty();
        emptyMono.subscribe(
            System.out::println,      // onNext (won't be called)
            Throwable::printStackTrace, // onError
            () -> System.out.println("Empty Mono completed") // onComplete
        );
        ```
    *   `Mono.error(Throwable error)`: Creates a `Mono` that terminates with the specified error.
        ```java
        Mono<String> errorMono = Mono.error(new RuntimeException("Something went wrong!"));
        errorMono.subscribe(
            System.out::println,
            err -> System.err.println("Error: " + err.getMessage())
        );
        ```
    *   `Mono.fromCallable(() -> T)`: Creates a `Mono` that produces its value by invoking the `Callable` when a subscriber subscribes. Useful for wrapping potentially blocking, single-value-producing code.
        ```java
        Mono<Long> timeMono = Mono.fromCallable(System::currentTimeMillis);
        // currentTimeMillis is called only upon subscription
        timeMono.subscribe(time -> System.out.println("Time: " + time));
        ```
    *   `Mono.defer(() -> Mono<T>)`: Creates a `Mono` by deferring the actual `Mono` creation until subscription time. This is crucial for ensuring that the logic to create the `Mono` (which might involve side effects or time-sensitive operations) is executed fresh for each subscriber.
        ```java
        Mono<Long> deferredTimeMono = Mono.defer(() -> Mono.just(System.currentTimeMillis()));
        Thread.sleep(100);
        deferredTimeMono.subscribe(t1 -> System.out.println("Deferred Time 1: " + t1)); // Gets current time
        Thread.sleep(100);
        deferredTimeMono.subscribe(t2 -> System.out.println("Deferred Time 2: " + t2)); // Gets later current time
        ```
    *   `Mono.delay(Duration duration)`: Emits `0L` after a specified duration.
        ```java
        Mono.delay(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
            .subscribe(val -> System.out.println("Delayed value: " + val)); // Prints 0 after 1 second
        ```

2.  **`Flux<T>` (Sequence - 0 to N items)**
    *   **Represents:** A publisher that can emit zero, one, or many (potentially an infinite number of) items, followed by either a completion signal or an error signal.
    *   **Analogy:** Think of it like a `java.util.Stream<T>` or `Iterable<T>` but asynchronous, push-based, and reactive.
    *   **Use Cases:**
        *   Fetching multiple records from a database (`findAll()`).
        *   Streaming data from a file or network connection.
        *   Representing a sequence of events (e.g., mouse clicks, incoming messages).
        *   An HTTP response body that is a JSON array or a stream of Server-Sent Events.

    **Common `Flux` Creation Methods:**
    *   `Flux.just(T... data)`: Creates a `Flux` that emits the provided items and then completes.
        ```java
        Flux<String> namesFlux = Flux.just("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
        namesFlux.subscribe(System.out::println); // Output: Alice, Bob, Charlie (on separate lines)
        ```
    *   `Flux.fromIterable(Iterable<T> it)`: Creates a `Flux` from an `Iterable` (like a `List`).
        ```java
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        Flux<Integer> numbersFlux = Flux.fromIterable(numbers);
        numbersFlux.subscribe(num -> System.out.print(num + " ")); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
        ```
    *   `Flux.fromStream(Stream<T> s)`: Creates a `Flux` from a Java `Stream`. The stream is consumed upon subscription.
        ```java
        Flux<String> streamFlux = Flux.fromStream(Stream.of("A", "B", "C"));
        streamFlux.subscribe(System.out::println);
        ```
    *   `Flux.range(int start, int count)`: Emits a sequence of integers starting from `start` and `count` items.
        ```java
        Flux.range(1, 5) // Emits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
            .subscribe(i -> System.out.print(i + " "));
        ```
    *   `Flux.interval(Duration period)`: Emits `Long` values starting from 0, incrementally, at specified time intervals. This is a "hot" source by default if not tied to a subscriber immediately. It runs on a timer scheduler.
        ```java
        // Flux.interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
        //     .take(3) // Important: Limit for infinite streams in examples
        //     .subscribe(tick -> System.out.println("Tick: " + tick));
        // Needs Thread.sleep in main to see output
        ```
    *   `Flux.empty()`: Creates a `Flux` that completes without emitting any items.
    *   `Flux.error(Throwable error)`: Creates a `Flux` that terminates with the specified error.
    *   `Flux.defer(() -> Flux<T>)`: Similar to `Mono.defer`, defers `Flux` creation until subscription.

**Operators: The Functions You Use with `Mono` and `Flux`**

Operators are methods that you call on a `Mono` or `Flux` instance. They allow you to transform, filter, combine, and otherwise manipulate the data stream.
**Key Characteristics of Operators:**
*   **Immutable:** Operators do not change the original `Mono` or `Flux`. Instead, they return a *new* `Mono` or `Flux` that represents the modified stream.
*   **Lazy:** The operations defined by the operators are not executed until someone `subscribe()`s to the final `Mono` or `Flux` in the chain.
*   **Composable:** You can chain multiple operators together to create complex data processing pipelines.

Here are some common categories and examples of operators:

---
**1. Transformation Operators** (Change the items or type of items in the stream)
---
*   **`map(Function<T, R> mapper)`**:
    *   Transforms each item `T` in the stream into an item `R` using the provided synchronous function.
    *   `Mono<T> -> Mono<R>`, `Flux<T> -> Flux<R>`
    ```java
    Flux.just(1, 2, 3)
        .map(i -> "Number: " + i)
        .subscribe(System.out::println);
    // Output:
    // Number: 1
    // Number: 2
    // Number: 3
    ```

*   **`flatMap(Function<T, Publisher<R>> mapper)`**:
    *   Transforms each item `T` into a new `Publisher<R>` (a `Mono<R>` or `Flux<R>`) and then flattens the emissions from these inner publishers into a single stream of `R`.
    *   Crucial for asynchronous operations. If your mapping function itself returns a `Mono` or `Flux`, you *must* use `flatMap`.
    *   `Mono<T> -> Mono<R>` (if mapper returns `Mono<R>`)
    *   `Mono<T> -> Flux<R>` (if mapper returns `Flux<R>`, use `flatMapMany`)
    *   `Flux<T> -> Flux<R>` (if mapper returns `Mono<R>` or `Flux<R>`)
    ```java
    // Example: Fetch user details for each user ID
    // Mono<UserDetails> getUserDetails(String userId) { ... }
    Flux.just("id1", "id2")
        .flatMap(userId -> getUserDetailsReactive(userId)) // getUserDetailsReactive returns Mono<UserDetails>
        .subscribe(userDetails -> System.out.println("User: " + userDetails));

    // Contrast with map, which would give Flux<Mono<UserDetails>>
    Flux.just("id1", "id2")
        .map(userId -> getUserDetailsReactive(userId))
        .subscribe(monoOfUserDetails -> monoOfUserDetails.subscribe(System.out::println)); // Awkward!
    ```
    *   `flatMap` does not guarantee order of inner publisher emissions.

*   **`concatMap(Function<T, Publisher<R>> mapper)`**:
    *   Similar to `flatMap`, but it waits for each inner publisher to complete before subscribing to the next one, thus preserving the order of the original sequence.
    *   Use when order is important and you're mapping to asynchronous operations.

*   **`switchMap(Function<T, Publisher<R>> mapper)`**:
    *   Similar to `flatMap`, but when a new item arrives from the outer source, it unsubscribes from the previously generated inner publisher and subscribes to the new one.
    *   Useful for scenarios like live search, where you only care about the results of the latest input.

*   **`cast(Class<R> clazz)`**:
    *   Tries to cast each element to the given type. If an element is not an instance of that type, it emits an `onError` signal.
    *   `Publisher<Object> -> Publisher<R>`

*   **`defaultIfEmpty(T defaultValue)`**:
    *   If the source `Mono` or `Flux` completes without emitting any items, this operator emits a single default value.
    *   `Mono<T> -> Mono<T>`, `Flux<T> -> Flux<T>` (emits default then completes if source is empty)
    ```java
    Mono.empty()
        .defaultIfEmpty("Default Value")
        .subscribe(System.out::println); // Output: Default Value
    ```

*   **`switchIfEmpty(Publisher<T> alternate)`**:
    *   If the source `Mono` or `Flux` completes without emitting any items, this operator subscribes to the provided alternative `Publisher`.
    ```java
    Mono.<String>empty()
        .switchIfEmpty(Mono.just("Alternative Value from Mono"))
        .subscribe(System.out::println); // Output: Alternative Value from Mono
    ```

---
**2. Filtering Operators** (Selectively emit items from the stream)
---
*   **`filter(Predicate<T> predicate)`**:
    *   Emits only those items from the source that satisfy the given predicate.
    ```java
    Flux.range(1, 10)
        .filter(i -> i % 2 == 0) // Keep only even numbers
        .subscribe(i -> System.out.print(i + " ")); // Output: 2 4 6 8 10
    ```

*   **`take(long n)` / `take(Duration d)`**:
    *   Emits only the first `n` items (or items emitted during duration `d`) from the source and then completes.
    ```java
    Flux.range(1, 100)
        .take(3)
        .subscribe(i -> System.out.print(i + " ")); // Output: 1 2 3
    ```

*   **`skip(long n)` / `skip(Duration d)`**:
    *   Skips the first `n` items (or items emitted during duration `d`) from the source.

*   **`distinct()`**:
    *   Emits only unique items from the source (based on `equals()`/`hashCode()`).
    ```java
    Flux.just(1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4)
        .distinct()
        .subscribe(i -> System.out.print(i + " ")); // Output: 1 2 3 4
    ```

*   **`elementAt(int index)` / `elementAt(int index, T defaultValue)`**:
    *   Emits only the item at the specified index. Returns a `Mono<T>`.
    *   If `defaultValue` is provided, it's emitted if the index is out of bounds.

*   **`single()` / `single(T defaultValue)` / `singleOrEmpty()`**:
    *   Expects the `Flux` to emit exactly one item (or zero for `singleOrEmpty`). If not, it errors (or emits default/empty). Returns a `Mono<T>`.

---
**3. Combining Operators** (Merge or orchestrate multiple streams)
---
*   **`mergeWith(Publisher<T> other)` / `Flux.merge(Publisher<T>... sources)`**:
    *   Merges items from multiple publishers into a single `Flux` as they arrive. Order is not guaranteed.
    ```java
    Flux<String> flux1 = Flux.just("A", "B").delayElements(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    Flux<String> flux2 = Flux.just("1", "2").delayElements(Duration.ofMillis(150));

    Flux.merge(flux1, flux2)
        .subscribe(System.out::println); // Possible output: A, 1, B, 2 (order might vary due to timing)
    ```

*   **`concatWith(Publisher<T> other)` / `Flux.concat(Publisher<T>... sources)`**:
    *   Concatenates items from multiple publishers sequentially. The next publisher is subscribed to only after the previous one completes. Order is preserved.
    ```java
    Flux<String> flux1 = Flux.just("A", "B");
    Flux<String> flux2 = Flux.just("1", "2");

    Flux.concat(flux1, flux2)
        .subscribe(System.out::println); // Output: A, B, 1, 2
    ```

*   **`zipWith(Publisher<U> other, BiFunction<T, U, R> combiner)` / `Flux.zip(P1, P2, ..., Combiner)`**:
    *   Combines items from multiple publishers pair-wise. It waits for an item from each source and then applies the combiner function. The resulting `Flux` completes when any of the sources complete.
    ```java
    Flux<String> names = Flux.just("Alice", "Bob");
    Flux<Integer> ages = Flux.just(30, 25, 40); // Note: '40' will be ignored

    names.zipWith(ages, (name, age) -> name + " is " + age)
         .subscribe(System.out::println);
    // Output:
    // Alice is 30
    // Bob is 25
    ```

*   **`combineLatest(Publisher<U> other, BiFunction<T, U, R> combiner)` / `Flux.combineLatest(P1, P2, ..., Combiner)`**:
    *   When *any* of the source publishers emit an item, it combines the *latest* emitted item from *each* source using the combiner function.
    *   Useful for scenarios where you want to react to changes in any of several inputs.

---
**4. Error Handling Operators** (React to or recover from errors)
---
*   **`onErrorReturn(T fallbackValue)`**:
    *   If an error occurs, emit a specified fallback value and then complete the stream.
    ```java
    Flux.just(1, 2, 0, 4)
        .map(i -> 10 / i) // Will cause ArithmeticException for 0
        .onErrorReturn(-1)
        .subscribe(System.out::println); // Output: 10, 5, -1
    ```

*   **`onErrorResume(Function<Throwable, Publisher<T>> fallback)`**:
    *   If an error occurs, invoke the fallback function, which returns a new `Publisher<T>` to subscribe to. This allows for more dynamic error recovery.
    ```java
    Flux.just("a", "b", "ERROR", "d")
        .flatMap(s -> {
            if (s.equals("ERROR")) return Mono.error(new RuntimeException("Simulated error"));
            return Mono.just("Processed: " + s);
        })
        .onErrorResume(e -> {
            System.err.println("Recovering from: " + e.getMessage());
            return Flux.just("Fallback1", "Fallback2"); // Switch to a fallback Flux
        })
        .subscribe(System.out::println);
    ```

*   **`onErrorMap(Function<Throwable, Throwable> mapper)`**:
    *   Transform an error signal into a different error signal.

*   **`retry(long n)` / `retryWhen(Retry retrySpec)`**:
    *   If an error occurs, re-subscribe to the original source up to `n` times, or based on a more complex `Retry` specification.

---
**5. Utility / Side-Effect Operators** (Logging, debugging, actions on lifecycle events)
---
*   **`doOnNext(Consumer<T> onNext)`**:
    *   Perform a side-effect (like logging) for each item emitted, without modifying the item.
*   **`doOnError(Consumer<Throwable> onError)`**:
    *   Perform a side-effect when an error occurs.
*   **`doOnComplete(Runnable onComplete)`**:
    *   Perform a side-effect when the stream completes successfully.
*   **`doFinally(Consumer<SignalType> onFinally)`**:
    *   Perform a side-effect when the stream terminates for any reason (complete, error, or cancel). `SignalType` indicates the termination reason.
*   **`log()`**:
    *   Logs all reactive stream signals (onSubscribe, request, onNext, onError, onComplete, cancel) using a default logger. Extremely useful for debugging.
    ```java
    Flux.range(1, 2).log().subscribe();
    ```

*   **`delayElements(Duration delay)`**:
    *   Delays the emission of each element by the specified duration.

---
**6. Backpressure Related Operators** (Manage flow control)
---
*   **`limitRate(int highTide)`**:
    *   Controls the request size made to the upstream publisher. It requests `highTide` initially, and then `highTide * 0.75` (low tide) when 75% of the items have been processed.
*   **`onBackpressureBuffer()`**: Buffers all signals if the downstream can't keep up. Can lead to `OutOfMemoryError` if the source is too fast.
*   **`onBackpressureDrop()`**: Drops incoming signals if the downstream is not ready.
*   **`onBackpressureLatest()`**: Keeps only the latest signal if the downstream is not ready, dropping intermediate ones.

---
**7. Schedulers / Threading Operators** (Control execution context)
---
*   **`subscribeOn(Scheduler scheduler)`**:
    *   Specifies the `Scheduler` (thread pool) on which the subscription (and thus the emission of items from the source) should happen. This affects the *entire chain upwards* from where it's placed.
    *   Common schedulers: `Schedulers.parallel()` (CPU-bound), `Schedulers.boundedElastic()` (I/O-bound, blocking tasks), `Schedulers.single()` (single dedicated thread).
*   **`publishOn(Scheduler scheduler)`**:
    *   Specifies the `Scheduler` on which the downstream operators (including `onNext`, `onError`, `onComplete` callbacks) will execute. This affects the chain *downwards* from where it's placed.

---
**The Golden Rule: Nothing Happens Until You `subscribe()`**
---
A chain of `Mono` or `Flux` operators simply defines a *blueprint* for processing. The actual work (data emission, transformation, filtering, etc.) only begins when a `Subscriber` subscribes to the final publisher in the chain.

There are several ways to subscribe:
*   `subscribe()`: Subscribes and triggers the flow, ignoring elements.
*   `subscribe(Consumer<T> onNext)`: Handles `onNext` signals.
*   `subscribe(Consumer<T> onNext, Consumer<Throwable> onError)`: Handles `onNext` and `onError`.
*   `subscribe(Consumer<T> onNext, Consumer<Throwable> onError, Runnable onComplete)`: Handles all three.
*   `subscribe(Consumer<T> onNext, Consumer<Throwable> onError, Runnable onComplete, Consumer<Subscription> onSubscribe)`: Handles all signals, including the initial subscription.
*   `block()`: (Use with extreme caution, only for testing or at the very end of a non-reactive boundary) Subscribes and blocks the current thread until the `Mono` emits a value or the `Flux` completes. **Avoid in reactive code paths.**
*   `blockFirst()` / `blockLast()`: For `Flux`.

This is a comprehensive overview. The best way to learn is to experiment with these operators. The `ReactorBasics.java` file from the previous guide is a good place to try them out! Project Reactor's Javadoc is also an excellent resource.
