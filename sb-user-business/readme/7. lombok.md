Lombok is a popular library in the Java ecosystem that helps to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes. It achieves this by providing annotations that automatically generate code during compilation. Some of the common tasks that Lombok simplifies include generating getters, setters, constructors, toString, equals, hashCode, and more.

Here's a brief overview of some of the features provided by Lombok:

1. **@Getter and @Setter**: These annotations generate getter and setter methods for class fields, respectively. You no longer need to write these methods manually; Lombok generates them at compile time.

2. **@NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor, and @RequiredArgsConstructor**: These annotations generate constructors with no arguments, constructors with all arguments, and constructors with required fields as arguments, respectively.

3. **@ToString**: This annotation generates a `toString()` method that includes the names and values of all non-static fields of the class.

4. **@EqualsAndHashCode**: This annotation generates `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods based on the class fields.

5. **@Data**: This annotation combines the functionality of `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, `@Getter`, and `@Setter`. It's a convenient way to quickly generate all these methods for a class.

6. **@Builder**: This annotation generates a builder pattern for constructing instances of the class with a fluent API.

7. **@Slf4j**: This annotation generates a logger field using the Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) framework.

8. **@Value**: This annotation is similar to `@Data`, but it creates an immutable class with final fields and no setters.

By using Lombok annotations, developers can write cleaner, more concise Java code without sacrificing readability. Lombok-generated code is automatically inserted into the compiled bytecode, but it doesn't affect the actual source code, making it a powerful tool for reducing boilerplate while maintaining clarity and maintainability.
